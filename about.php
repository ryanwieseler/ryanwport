    <h2>About</h2>
     <p>I am a web designer based out of Seattle, Washington. My goal is to provide a vehicle through which your business, organization, or artistic idea will best be visually represented on the web. I also aim to provide the most pleasurable user experience possible for your customers.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a Production Artist at <a target="_blank" class="in-para-link" href="http://www.sharebuilder.com">ShareBuilder</a>. I am learning a lot and enjoying it thoroughly!</p>
  <p>My key interest lies in in user-centered and responsive web design. I am always working to improve my skill in responsive design, as well as expand my JavaScript, jQuery, and mobile design capabilities. Other interests of mine include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rt_wies" title="Ryan Wieseler's Photography on Flickr">photography</a>, bicycling around the beautiful western Washington countryside, live music, and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who will win the 2014 NBA Finals.</p>
