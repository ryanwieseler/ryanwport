          <li><strong>Client:</strong> Danie Eagleton, M Ed. LMHC</li>
          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Co-web design, Project Manager, logo design</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <em>to create an identity and online presence for Danie Eagleton and for Eagletonhope.com to be an information portal for mental illness.</em></p>
        <p>This project was for my final design course and Seattle Central Community College. My assignment was to create a working shell for a non-profit client: Danie Eagleton. Danie is a mental health counselor and consultant, as well as an instructor at Seattle Central Community College.</p>
        <p>I co-designed, project-managed, polished deliverables, and updated Danie's logo. I also served as the hub of communication between Danie and the team, which consisted of myself, another designer and a developer. We worked very hard in an eight-week period to meet her goals. The end deliverables included a custom Wordpress tutorial on how to create posts, add/update content, along with additional Wordpress resources.</p>

        <p>Based on our interview with Danie, two primary actions were decided upon for the site: mental health information and connecting with Danie. This was our motivation behind ordering the navigation, breaking down the information within each navigation item and planning for expansion and growth (press releases, user accounts, etc).<a class="btt" href="#top"><img class="arrow" src="images/up-arrow.png" width="14" height="14" alt="Up Arrow" />Back to Top</a></p>

        <p><strong>Intuitive Site Navigation</strong></p>
        <p>Understanding that our audience has an extremely broad range of experience with the internet, we used a conventional navigation to allow them to intuitively discover information they need.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear URL List and Navigation Layout</strong></p>
        <p>Following conventional listings of titles, authors, and publication allows user to focus on the actual content of resources.</p>
        <p><strong>Highly Visible Call to Action</strong></p>
        <p>A large spotlight image on the homepage and prominent placement of the about section in the main navigation clearly declares and entices users to contact Danie.<a class="btt" href="#top"><img class="arrow" src="images/up-arrow.png" width="14" height="14" alt="Up Arrow" />Back to Top</a></p>

      <p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>
        <p>Danie is keen on the color orange. It coveys her energetic, warm, and positive personality well. It also reinforces the idea of positive change that each person is trying to make when seeking Danieâ€™s assistance.</p>
        <p>Danie wanted an exciting and vibrant website but at the same not distract the user from information. I chose an orange that wouldn't over-power the text, rounded corners and high contrast type color to really focus the attention on the information. Everything was set on top of a 960 Grid for order and balance and strong borders were avoided.<a class="btt" href="#top"><img class="arrow" src="images/up-arrow.png" width="14" height="14" alt="Up Arrow" />Back to Top</a></p>
