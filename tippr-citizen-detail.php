        <h3>Tippr / Citizen Coffee Discount Card</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal: </strong><em>To create a unique and interesting design that would easily identify Tippr employees to Citizen baristas.</em></p>
        <p>When the Tippr office was located in Lower Queen Anne, employees were offered a great discount from <a class="in-para-link" href="http://citizencoffee.com" target="_blank">Citizen Coffee</a>. I was asked to design a card to present upon purchase at Citizen.</p>
        <p>I incorporated the texture used for the background on the <a class="in-para-link" href="http://citizencoffee.com" target="_blank">Citizen Coffee website</a>, along with their branding, to give the card some style and life. Coffee is a central part of their business, so the mug and the coffee beans were added to link Citizen with Tippr.</p>
