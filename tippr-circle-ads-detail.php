        <h3>Tippr Online Ads</h3>       
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <em>To create a new eye-catching concept to attract new customers.</em></p> 
        <p>I was tasked with designing a new series of Tippr advertisements that would stand out to even a casual eye.  This design was a departure from the standard Tippr logo, and was a forerunning piece to the Tippr marketing campaign.  The purpose of this particular design was to create something visually stimulating that would both appeal to current subscribers and interest potential consumers.</p>
