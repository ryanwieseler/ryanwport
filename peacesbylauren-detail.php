          <li><strong>Client:</strong> Lauren Cooley</li>
          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Web design, HTML&amp;CSS, photography</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <em>To create a unique and personable website to showcase her jewelry.</em></p>
        <p>Lauren Cooley is a jewelry designr based in Seattle. All of the materials she uses are sourced from Seattle and the surrounding areas.</p>
        <p>Along with showcasing her jewelry, the website also serves as a tool to steer potential customers to purchase pieces or visit Lauren in person. She wanted the design to reflect her personality and style. Originally from southern California, she has a very warm and thoughtful personality that glows, which is reflected in the warm color palette. The logo was provided to me and inspired the curved, transparent borders.</p>
